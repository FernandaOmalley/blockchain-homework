#Case Study Proposal: Shopify

##What Is It


Shopify started in Ottawa – Canada, it has grown from 5 people in a coffee shop to over 5,000 across the globe. They provide infrastructure for retailers to set up their stores online from small to big companies. Their online platform is used by big brands like Allbirds, MVMT, Kylie Cosmetics, Unilever, and others. Business owners can use Shopify to design, set up, manage their stores, collect payment, and even measure customers satisfaction across multiple sales channels including web, mobile, social media, and pop-up shops. 


##Why This May be Interesting


Multiple Channel Selling allowing to integrate products with marketplaces like Amazon, Ebay, or Etsy. As well as social media.
Inventory System that allows you organize and edit items without a hassle.
User friendly features, thank offer everything you might need. And if a feature can’t be found, it’s just check out the app store that offer free and premium services.
Customer Support – Shopify will send a credit card reader when you sign up with them so you can sell your goods in person. The store can function online or in person.
